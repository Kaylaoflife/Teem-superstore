### key Findings

Sales Trends & Insights
1. West ($147.88K) and East region ($128.68K) are the highest revenue-generating regions, making them a key focus for marketing and expansion efforts.  

2. Sales in the second half year surpassed H1, indicating the importance of that period in the sales cycle. It’s worth noting that except for Q4, quarterly sales typically reached a climax in the last month of each quarter. September is the month with the highest sales, while February has the lowest sales. 

3. Technology ($175.28K) generates the highest revenue driven by a range of high-value products – including phones & machines. The best-selling tech product is Cisco Telepresence System EX90, recording $23K in sales. However, Office Supplies enjoys frequent purchases, making it a steady revenue stream.

4. Furniture category is consistently unprofitable across multiple segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) and regions (Central, East, South).

### Recommendations

1. The dip in sales in December presents a great opportunity to leverage end-of-year promotions to drive sales 

2. Ensure optimal availability for the top-performing products, including Cisco  Telepresence System, particularly in high-demand regions (West & East)  and peak periods.  

3. Creatively leverage product bundling to drive offtake for slower-moving items.

4. Reevaluate regional pricing strategies and marketing alignment, with a focus on analyzing customer complaints particularly in low-profit cities.
